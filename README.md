A11y Extension
======================

When right-clicking an element with either a "aria-describedat" or a "longdesc"
HTML attribute, an item is added to the context menu. This new element allows
the user to navigate to the hyperlink specified by the HTML attribute.

Additionally, this extension optionally adds a thick, vibrant border around
HTML elements with the aforementioned attributes.
